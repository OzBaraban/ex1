**answer to q1 ex1***
If a division will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the quantization procedure will crash because when trying
to find the minial q values we divide the sum of (z(i)+1 to z(i) of g*h(g)) where g runs from z(i)+1 to z(i) in
the sum of h(g). we notice that h(g) means the histogram for the current z(i), so for a segemnt without pixels at all
the algorithm will divide the experssion by zero, which is not valid. And the program will crash. And thats why we need
to find the initial division for z's.
